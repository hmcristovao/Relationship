Some icons have been duplicated from the org.eclipse.jdt.ui._xyz.jar
 in the Eclipse plugins directory and then modified.

To edit and save gif icons with background transparency set, I used IrfanView (4.3.3):
- on "Save" or "Save as", check "Show options dialog"
  in the dialog box, in the Gif frame,
   check "Save interlaced" and
   either check "Set transparency value to palette entry" and set number to "11" (or other)
    which is found:
    either by picking the background color with the "Color-picker" tool,
     then with the "Display pen and brush settings" tool click on the Color image,
     and in the "Color selection" dialog find the Index at the bottom,
    or by clicking on the color in the "Paint" dialog which opens the same
     "Color selection" dialog,
   or check "Choose transparent color during saving", and on save click on a pixel in the image
