	<concept id="c1" label="Knowledge organization" short-comment="The term knowledge organization (KO) (or 'organization of knowledge', 'organization of information' or 'information organization') designates a field of study related to Library and Information Science (LIS).  In this meaning, KO is about activities such as document description, indexing and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives etc. These activities are done by librarians, archivists, subject specialists as well as by computer algorithms. KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) as well as the knowledge organizing systems (KOS) used to organize documents, document representations and concepts.There exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about organizing knowledge, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: “What is knowledge organization?” differently. Library Information Service professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been Traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. It is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding. The leading journal in this field is Knowledge Organization published by the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO). See also 'Lifeboat for Knowledge Organization'.A broad introduction to knowledge organization can be found in Hoetzlein (2007).@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>

	<concept id="c3" label="Semantic Web" short-comment="The Semantic Web is a collaborative movement led by international standards body the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standard promotes common data formats on the World Wide Web. By encouraging the inclusion of semantic content in web pages, the Semantic Web aims at converting the current web, dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents into a 'web of data'. The Semantic Web stack builds on the W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF).According to the W3C, 'The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries'. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data that can be processed by machines.While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept. Scholars have explored the social potential of the semantic web in the business and health sectors, and for social networking.The original 2001 Scientific American article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web, but this has yet to happen. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: 'This simple idea...remains largely unrealized'.@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>
	<concept id="c4" label="World Wide Web Consortium" short-comment="The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3).Founded and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations which maintain full-time staff for the purpose of working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 24 May 2014, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 385 members.W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>
	<concept id="c5" label="Tim Berners-Lee" short-comment="Sir Timothy John 'Tim' Berners-Lee, OM, KBE, FRS, FREng, FRSA, DFBCS (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that same year.Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the Web's continued development. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, and is a senior researcher and holder of the Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was honoured as the 'Inventor of the World Wide Web' during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted 'This is for everyone', which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>
	<concept id="c6" label="Paul Otlet" short-comment="; French: [?tle]; 23 August 1868 – 10 December 1944) was a Belgian author, entrepreneur, visionary, lawyer and peace activist; he is one of several people who have been considered the father of information science, a field he called 'documentation'. Otlet created the Universal Decimal Classification, one of the most prominent examples of faceted classification. Otlet was responsible for the widespread adoption in Europe of the standard American 3x5 inch index card used until recently in most library catalogs around the world (by now largely displaced by the advent of the online public access catalog (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the Traité de Documentation (1934) and Monde: Essai d'universalisme (1935).In 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and Henri La Fontaine created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the Union of International Associations in 1910, and which is still located in Brussels. They also created a great international center called at first Palais Mondial (World Palace), later, the Mundaneum to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes.Otlet and La Fontaine were peace activists who endorsed the internationalist politics of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (the forerunner of UNESCO). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization the an emerging global polity, and wished to help solidify it. La Fontaine won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913.@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>

It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats. It is also used in knowledge management applications.The RDF 1.1 specification was published in 2014.@en (font: DBPEDIA)" long-comment=""/>
